# ArcOS Extensive Rewrite March 4th 2022
It is time. It is time to do the one thing we all feared for the greater part of the development cycle. A full, extensive rewrite, with a new framework, development plan, UI, everything. A renewal at last.

This was long feared considering the massive overhead development we'd have to go through while trying to rewrite over 10K lines of code.

## Basic principle
The basic principle is simple. Rewrite the ArcOS Codebase with a different framework and as modular as humanly possible. This includes a complete reconfiguration of basically everything, we're now using Vite, Typescript, a bit of SCSS, svelte, and much more. This improved base layer will hopefully provide ArcOS with a stable base to build upon. Given that we can build it, of course.
